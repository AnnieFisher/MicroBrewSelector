Full Stack Group MVC Project - Colorado Microbrew Directory.

Technologies used:
Spring MVC
JPA
MySQL
HTML/CSS
Git

To wrap up the program's Java/SpringMVC/JPA materials we built a full stack app in a group.
Our app allows users to register and save favorites, up-vote beers they like, and add beers to the directory.
Guests can browse the directory, but have no other privileges.

We began by discussing our proposal at length with each other before presenting the project to our instructors.
Our next step was to build our database. We then made entity classes in the JPA portion of our workspace
and then moved on to the MVC portion.

How to use:

Users begin by accessing the site through an aws website. Users can then choose a login option. If they don't have an existing account, they can make one by providing a username and password, as well as optional fields of name and city/state. The location information is used to populate a map with local liquor stores relative to their area. If the user logs in as a guest, they are only able to view the main directory page. If the user is logged in with a username, they can add to the databse, upvote beers, add favorites to a persistant directory page, and view details about each beer on the list based on taste/type/style and brand. 

Users can update their user information, adjusting all fields except username and password. They can also delete their account. 

The site administrator logs in with a unique username and password and has special privileges. The admin can remove beers from the directory and edit them. The admin can also remove users.
