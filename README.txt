Full Stack Group MVC Project - Colorado Beer Directory.

Technologies used:
Spring MVC
JPA
MySQL
HTML/CSS


To wrap up the program's Java/SpringMVC/JPA materials we built a full stack app in a group.
Our app allows users to register and save favorites, up-vote beers they like, and add beers to the directory.
Guests can browse the directory, but have no other privileges.

We began by discussing our proposal at length with each other before presenting the project to our instructors.
Our next step was to build our database. We then made entity classes in the JPA portion of our workspace
and then moved on to the MVC portion.
